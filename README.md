# Journo
Just a normal quotes app made by an aspiring developer/programmer. *A minimalist offline journal & quote app.*

Don't expect a good README file from me. I'm just lazy. I do like documentation but I don't want to.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Just copy these codes into your Terminal and you're good to go.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nikhil-Nirupam-Sahoo/Journo.git
cd Journo
npm install
npm run dev
```
